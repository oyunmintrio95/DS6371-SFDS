# Test of significance

## Hypothesis Test
- We use a formal hypothesis test to determine whether a sample supports a hypothesized parameter value.
- Recall:
  - We used the central limit theorem to estimate a range of likely values for mu using confidence intervals.
  - We can also use the CLT to estimate a sample distribution.
- Example hypothesis test:
  - Is the normal human body temperature 98.6 F
  - Can we support this hypothesis by checking a random sample of healthy individuals?
 
## Example Test: Emotional Intelligence
- What if we knew the mu for regular students(not gifted and talented)?
- How do we determine whter the EI of gifted and talented students is different from the regular students?
- We can do a two-sample test:
    - Sample the EI of gifted and talented students
    - Sample the EI of regular students
    - Is the difference 0, or is it larger than expected by chance?

## Example Test: Sodium Content
- Quality control at the potato chip factory
- Is your sodium content as advertised?
- To test:
  - Take a random sample from the assembly line.
  - Measure the sodium content.
  - Is the sample mean x-bar close enough to the advertised target?
  - Is the difference small enough to be chance rather than a problem with the machine?
